## Week 7 Homework Assignment, Coding Boot Camp, UNC-Chapel Hill

- Game starts once two users connect.
- Player 1 chooses rock, paper or scissors first. Then Player 2 chooses and the result is shown.
- Both users can chat or change their nickname in real time.

The emphasis of this assignment was initial work with databases - Firebase in this case. Firebase is used to relay various game states to both users, such as which player's turn it is and what each player chooses for their hand. The hand visuals are also done in HTML and CSS entirely so that the game state (ideally) loads faster for each player instead of having to load images.
